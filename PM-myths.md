1. Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project

There are benefits to the project manager not having a lot of technical knowledge about a project. Rather than getting caught up in the technical details when communicating with management and stakeholders, the project manager can look at all of the different pieces that the cross-functional team is working on and assess how they each contribute to the success of the project.

On the contrary, having (a necessarily limited) knowledge in a certain field, PM may take sides when team members disagree on a technical detail, and influence the decision making in suboptimal way,  may break trust in one of teammate's expertise, and distort the perception of the whole project end goals.

PM job is to handle the communication, documentation, and organization necessary to get the project successfully to the finish line.

2. Myth: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.

To be a successful project manager at any organization—regardless of whether you have worked there previously — it is essential to master the skills, tools, and techniques of project management.

3. Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times.

Details matter in project execution, but a PM must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project.

If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.

PM communicates with your stakeholders, clarifies objectives, and sets expectations. Trust the team to handle the details of each project task and communicate with you when there’s an issue. Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers for your team. This is where you add value
