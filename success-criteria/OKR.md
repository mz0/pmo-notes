# OKR - Objectives and Key Results - progress evaluation

OKRs—Objectives and Key Results--combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.

* **Share OKRs with team** so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts.
  OKRs help your project team stick to its goals, monitor which are falling short,
  and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives. 

* **Assign owners**. This helps add clarity and increases accountability.

## Measuring progress
* Determine **how you will score your OKRs**. OKRs can be scored in different ways.
  You can score based on a percentage of the objective completed, the completion of certain milestones,
  or a scale of 1 to 10, for example.
  At Google, OKRs are usually graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning the objective was fully achieved.
  Each individual key result is graded and then the grades are averaged to determine the score for that OKR.
* **Set scoring expectations**. With Google’s 0.0–1.0 scale, the expectation is to set ambitious OKRs and aim
  to achieve an average of at least 0.6 to 0.7 across all OKRs. For OKRs graded according to percentage achieved,
  the sweet spot is somewhere in the 60–70% range. Scoring lower may mean the team is not achieving what it could be.
  Scoring higher may mean the aspirational goals are not being set high enough. 
* **Schedule checkpoints**. regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with your team and senior managers.
