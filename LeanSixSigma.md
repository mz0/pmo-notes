## Lean and Kanban

Lean 5S:
1. **Sort**: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.
2. **Set in order**: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
3. **Shine**: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
4. **Standardize**: Perform the process in the same way every time.
5. **Sustain**: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

Lean uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes.
1. defects
2. excess processing
3. overproduction
4. waiting
5. inventory
6. transportation
7. motion
8. non-utilized talent.

Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

## Six Sigma
1. Always focus on the customer.
2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
3. Make your processes flow smoothly.
4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
5. Stop defects by removing variation.
6. Involve and collaborate with your team.
7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way

Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called *DMAIC*, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of *Lean* and *Six Sigma* approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
