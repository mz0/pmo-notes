## SMART Goals
* **S**pecific
* **M**easurable
* **A**ttainable
* **R**elevant
* **T**ime-bound

## Objectives - Key results (OKR)

Strong objectives meet the following criteria. They are:
* Aspirational
* Aligned with organizational goals
* Action-oriented
* Concrete
* Significant

Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound. They can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

Strong key results meet the following criteria:

* Results-oriented — not a task
* Measurable and verifiable
* Specific and time-bound
* Aggressive yet realistic

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team the following:
* What does success mean?
* What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

OKR development best practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

* Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it. 
* As a general rule, try to develop around 2–-3  key results for each objective.
* Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.
